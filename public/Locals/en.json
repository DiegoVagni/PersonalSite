Ho anche riadattato parte di codice preso online, in quanto anch'esso è parte del lavoro di un ingegnere. \n Lavorare su di esso mi ha permesso di rafforzare le conoscenze riguardanti le tecnologie usate e imparare meglio l'utilizzo delle animazioni.",

My partner and I decided to do something similar to the game Fall Guys, developed for single player. Together with my colleague we developed everything necessary for a basic game. Personally, I worked particularly hard on the procedural generation of game paths. \nThis project was excellent for strengthening knowledge, which was still only amateur at the time , regarding Unity",

In two years I had opportunity to see a large project born and grow by working daily on both the client and server sides.\nThis is the work that most allowed me to learn the use of Unity and C#, as well as to refine my software architecture skills. I also had the opportunity to work on distributed systems, and develop a working multiplayer system.",

  "Tesi_Description": "I developed the thesis in the field of game development. The goal was to create, in Unity, a procedurally generated world similar to that of Minecraft.\n I decided to use an Octree, a tree structure, to represent the world. The peculiarity of the Octree is the variable size of the leaves, which I exploited to improve gaming performance. Thanks to this I opted to generate several chunks also on the Y axis of the world, unlike Minecraft where this does not happen.\n Another fundamental aspect of the work was the attention to the extensibility and optimization of the code. \nThe thesis was evaluated very positively, as I provided a working product. \nNowadays the system is still functional, but it needs a couple of more precautions before being put into a production environment.",

Having worked with Photonengine and having noticed its limitations, I decided to try to build a library myself. The goal of the project is to develop a system that is easy to integrate within any C# application that allows communication via the network. The library already offers great support for the creation of centralized applications and software. \nThe library already defines everything necessary for the operation of a server and a client, already adding a user and resource control system. The system is extremely expandable. At the moment it is one of the best works I have done, in which I have included all the skills gained over the years. Git will be available as soon as the documentation is finished and I can make it Opensource.",

  "FirstSteps_Description": "I was born in Milan on February 1, 1994.\nEver since I discovered the world of information technology I have been passionate about the topic.\nAfter middle school I continued my studies, obtaining the scientific high school diploma in 2012.\nBefore I could enrolling at university, I had the opportunity to do an internship at H-Farm, a StartUp incubator. I stayed there for a year, moving between different Startups. This experience was the first important one in my life, giving me the opportunity to learn a lot and even spend two months in London, where I improved my English.\n\nSince I was little, moreover, I have always had the opportunity to spend several months a year at the Osho Circle School, a common of meditation where I had the opportunity to learn about meditation and work on myself from a young age.",

  "SUPSIME": "University",
  "SUPSIME_Description": "In 2015 I started the degree course in computer engineering at SUPSI in Manno (Switzerland). The university allowed me to touch on many branches of my profession, giving me a good basis for most fields of my profession. Each field Furthermore, it has its own technologies, so over the years I have learned to use most of today's most requested languages. Furthermore, since SUPSI is a very practical university, in those years there was no shortage of projects in each course to do individually or in groups. Furthermore, the professors have always invited us to work in an Agile way, helping the integration within company systems even more also from a human point of view.\n In 2018 I had to block the university for a year so I had the opportunity to follow a web development course at the TAG innovation school in Milan. Thanks to that experience I was able to participate in a Hackaton organized by Vodafone regarding Tobi, their automatic customer management system. Not only did I win the Hackaton, together with my group, but I also had the opportunity to do an internship for several months with them, again in Milan. This internship gave me an inside look at a large company for the first time, as well as my ability to get an idea of ​​how software works solely from its output. Thanks to this ability, in fact, I immediately learned to use most of the company tools in an expert manner, much to the surprise of myself.\n In 2019 I return to university to deliver my thesis in June 2021, completing my studies.",

  "G3CLABSME_Description": "Shortly before the delivery of my thesis, in 2021, G3CLabs of Rome contacted me to develop an application together with them. The application had to manage several users, giving them the possibility of entering a 3D environment and speaking or chatting between of them with spatial audio. The system was also supposed to be distributed for Android and IOS. \nThe experience in G3CLabs allowed me to face a great challenge starting from scratch, refining my software architecture techniques and allowing me to work on the within a team, also developing a Seniority. I had the opportunity to touch every point of the development of an application that was released into production, developing in an Agile manner and with the help of automatic tests. The strong networking component of the project also allowed me allowed us to develop a strong foundation when it comes to multiplayer development.",

  "OnlyMe_Description": "In March 2023 I decided to leave G3CLabs on good terms to take a sabbatical and focus on my other passions and the study of new technologies, as well as personal projects. Much of the development done this year was regarding a networking library. Thanks to the experience gained and the knowledge of the tools on the market, I took the opportunity to develop my own library to make it easier for me to develop future projects. \nI also used this time to update myself on the artificial intelligences, closely following OpenAI and using the AUTOMATIC1111 gui to locally use Stable diffusion to generate images. This allowed me to learn not only the stable diffusion pipeline, but also have a better understanding of how to write prompts for an AI. ",
