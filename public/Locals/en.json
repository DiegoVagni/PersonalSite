  "Site_Description": "Needing a space to showcase my work, I made the site proof of what I could do. I opted to create as much as possible in an original way (such as the localization system or the possibility of changing themes) without using libraries precisely to be more flexible and effective in maintaining the code. I have, at times, re-adapted part of the code taken online, as it is also part of the work of an engineer. Working on it allowed me to strengthen my knowledge of the technologies used and learn how to use animations better.",

  "LastRun_Description": "During the Game Development course at Supsi (Italian Swiss University School), I developed, together with a course colleague, the creation of a game of my choice, inspired by Fall Guys, created for a single player. We have also developed everything needed for a primary game. I worked particularly hard on the procedural generation of game paths. This project was helpful in strengthening the knowledge, then still only amateur, regarding Unity.",

After three days in which I only partially dedicated myself to the project, I still obtained an appreciated result, even though I wasn't entirely satisfied with the graphics. In particular, the graphics relating to dynamic flowers and leaves on the input board were appreciated. Within the project, I used different code styles (class components | functional components).",

  "SmashWorld_Description": "Before starting to work on my thesis, I was hired at G3CLabs (Rome) as a developer. The work was focused on creating a platform where users could have a 3D experience within a metaverse and had to be able to support VR and an application for Android and IOS and cross-platforming. The project was developed entirely from scratch, allowing me to be involved in creating the entire system architecture. In two years, I saw a large project born and grow, working daily on both the client and server sides. This is the work that most allowed me to learn the use of Unity and C# and refine my software architecture skills. I also had the chance to work on distributed systems and develop a working multiplayer system.",

  "LudoGame_Description": "This project was carried out together with a course colleague; we learned how to use Photonengine, the central multiplayer API system for Unity. To do this, we developed the virtual version of the LUDO game and are also thinking about expanding it. Each pawn in the game is equivalent to a character with its specific abilities. The development of this project was fundamental to fully understanding the different challenges of an online gaming system and how to solve them effectively.",

  "Tesi_Description": "I developed my dissertation in the field of Game Development. The goal was to create, in Unity, a procedurally generated world similar to that of Minecraft. I used an Octree, a tree structure, to represent the world. The Octree's peculiarity is the leaves' variable size, intentionally used to improve gaming performance. Thanks to this, I opted to generate several chunks on the Y axis of the world, unlike Minecraft, where this does not happen. Another fundamental aspect of the work was the attention to the extensibility and optimization of the codeâ€”the thesis was evaluated very positively, as I provided an immediately fungible product.",

  "Comunication_Framework_Description": "In March 2023, having worked with Photonengine and having noticed its limitations, I decided to try to build a library independently. The project's objective is to develop a system that is easy to integrate within any C# application that allows communication via the network. The library already offers excellent support for creating centralized applications and software. The library defines everything necessary to operate a server and a client, adding a user and resource control system. The system is highly expandable and includes all the capabilities gained over the year. The git will be available as soon as the documentation is finished, and I can make it open source.",

  "FirstSteps": "First steps",
  "FirstSteps_Description": "I was born in Milan on February 1, 1994. I have been passionate about this discipline since I discovered the world of IT. After middle school, I continued my studies, obtaining the scientific high school diploma in 2012. Before enrolling in university, I had the opportunity to intern at H-Farm, a StartUp incubator. I stayed there for a year, moving between different startups. This professionalizing experience was the first important one in my life, allowing me to learn a lot and stay for several months in London, where I perfected my English. Furthermore, since I was little, I have had the opportunity to spend several months a year at a meditation school in the Marche region, where I had the chance to experiment with different meditation techniques and get to know myself better.",

  "SUPSIME": "University",
  "SUPSIME_Description": "In 2015, I started a degree course in computer engineering at SUPSI in Manno (Switzerland). The study path allowed me to touch on many IT fields, giving me a reasonable basis for most fields of my profession. Each field has its technologies, so I have learned to use of today's most requested languages over the years. Since SUPSI is a university with laboratory methodology, in those years, there was no shortage of projects in each specific course to be done both individually and in groups. Furthermore, the professors have always invited us to work in an Agile way, helping the integration within company systems even more from a human point of view. 2018, I dedicated a year to a web development course at the TAG Innovation School in Milan. Thanks to that experience, I participated in a hackathon organized by Vodafone regarding Tobi, their automatic customer management system. Not only did I win the Hackathon, together with my work group, but I also had the opportunity to intern for several months in the Milan office. This internship allowed me to observe a large company from the inside and taught me how the software works, starting from its output. Thanks to this expertise, I immediately learned to use most company tools expertly, with a pleasant surprise. In 2019, I returned to university to deliver my thesis in June 2021, finishing my degree in Computer Engineering.",

  "G3CLABSME": "G3CLabs",
  "G3CLABSME_Description": "Shortly before the delivery of my dissertation work in 2021, G3CLabs of Rome contacted me to develop an application together with them. The application had to manage multiple users, allowing them to enter a 3D environment and talk or chat with each other with spatial audio. The system was also supposed to be distributed for Android and IOS. The experience in G3CLabs allowed me to face a significant challenge starting from scratch, refining my software architecture techniques and allowing me to work within a team and develop a Seniority quickly. I had the opportunity to touch every point of the development of an application released into production, created Agilely, and with the help of automatic tests. The vital networking component of the project also allowed me to develop a solid foundation in multiplayer development.",

  "OnlyMe": "Gap year",
  "OnlyMe_Description": "In March 2023, I took a sabbatical to focus on my passions, the study of new technologies, and personal projects. Much of the development done this year has been around a networking library. Thanks to the experience gained and the knowledge of the tools on the market, I took the opportunity to develop my library to make it easier for me to create future projects. I also used this time to update myself on artificial intelligence, closely following OpenAI and using the AUTOMATIC1111 GUI in local Stable diffusion to generate images. This allowed me to learn the stable diffusion pipeline and better understand how to write prompts for an AI.",
  "Passions": "Passions",
  "Passions_Description": "In addition to IT, I have several passions. One of the biggest concerns is comics, which I love collecting. By now, my library has reached considerable dimensions, and I consider myself an expert in the field. I have another great passion for video games, which I now love to use more to marvel at the technical wonders rather than for the gameplay itself or the story. I also spend much time walking in nature and traveling, using smart working."
